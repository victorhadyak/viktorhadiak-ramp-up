Lambda function that automate the process of creating Jira tickets.

-PagerDuty sends a webhook payload to the Lambda function, which parses the payload to extract the incident ID and summary.

-The function then uses the Jira REST API to create a new Jira ticket, with the incident summary as the ticket summary, and the incident URL as the ticket description.

-Once the Jira ticket is created, the function uses the Webex Teams REST API to send a message to a specified Webex Teams space, notifying of the new ticket and providing a link to the Jira ticket.
